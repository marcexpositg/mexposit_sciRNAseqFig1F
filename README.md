# mexposit_sciRNAseqFig1F

This repository contains the code to reproduce Figure 1F from *Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism, Cao et.al. (Science, 2017)*.

- Run `InstallMonocle.R` to install the Monocle 3 library on a fresh R 4.0.2 installation.
- See `sciRNAseq_Figure1F.Rmd` for the code and explanation to reproduce Figure 1F of the reference article. The result can be seen in `sciRNAseq_Figure1F.html`, which has been converted to a GitHub Page accessible at: https://marcexpositg.github.io/mexposit_sciRNAseqFig1F/sciRNAseq_Figure1F.html.
